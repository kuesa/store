# Store
An open-source e-commerce site built with React + Redux, with styling by Ant Design and payment handling by Stripe. For now, this is being developed to facilitate my personal store, but some changes will be made to allow modularity for public use.

## Installing/Running Development
1. Clone both this repo and the server repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Use `npm start` to run. Follow instructions in the server repo to get the server running.

## Production
Use `npm build` to create production-ready files to be deployed on a webserver. 

## Making Changes
In the future, minimal (or no) changes will have to be made to the frontend, and the data containing product information and store styling will be passed via the webserver. Right now, however, changes will need to be made to facilitate your own store here.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute (follow standard procedures for contributing)! As of now, I am looking to finish my own site first before I start making this more public-friendly, so I probably won't be responding to pull requests until then.
